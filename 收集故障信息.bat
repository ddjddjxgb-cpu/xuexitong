rem  xuexitong - collect diagnostics
rem  Double-click this file to gather a diagnostics bundle.
rem
rem  Kept pure ASCII on purpose: cmd.exe reads .bat in the OEM
rem  codepage, so non-ASCII text here shows up as mojibake on
rem  Chinese Windows. All user-facing Chinese lives in the
rem  PowerShell script, which handles encoding properly.
rem
rem  Does NOT require Xuexitong.exe to be runnable -- "double-click
rem  crashes instantly" is itself a reportable failure, and an exe
rem  based collector could not gather evidence for it.
